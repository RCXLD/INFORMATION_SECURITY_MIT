<h1>Homework: intro to xv6</h1>

<p>This lecture is the introduction to xv6, our re-implementation of
  Unix v6.  Read the source code in the assigned files;  The assigned
  chapter for today provides a commentary on the  assigned files.
<p> You won't have to understand the details yet; we will focus on how
  the first user-level process comes into existence after the computer
  is turned on.
<p>

<b>Hand-In Procedure</b>
<p>
You are to turn in this homework during lecture. Please
write up your answers to the exercises below and hand them in to a
6.828 staff member at the beginning of lecture.
<p>

<p><b>Assignment</b>: 
<br>
Fetch and un-tar the xv6 source:

<pre>
sh-3.00$ wget http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2009/src/xv6-rev3.tar.gz 
sh-3.00$ tar xzvf xv6-rev3.tar.gz
xv6/
xv6/asm.h
xv6/bio.c
xv6/bootasm.S
xv6/bootmain.c
...
$
</pre>

Build xv6:
<pre>
$ cd xv6
$ make
gcc -O -nostdinc -I. -c bootmain.c
gcc -nostdinc -I. -c bootasm.S
ld -N -e start -Ttext 0x7C00 -o bootblock.o bootasm.o bootmain.o
objdump -S bootblock.o > bootblock.asm
objcopy -S -O binary bootblock.o bootblock
...
$ 
</pre>

Find the address of the <code>main</code> function by
looking in <code>kernel.asm</code>:
<pre>
% grep main kernel.asm
...
00102454 &lt;mpmain&gt;:
mpmain(void)
001024d0 &lt;main&gt;:
  10250d:       79 f1                   jns    102500 &lt;main+0x30&gt;
  1025f3:       76 6f                   jbe    102664 &lt;main+0x194&gt;
  102611:       74 2f                   je     102642 &lt;main+0x172&gt;
</pre>
In this case, the address is <code>001024d0</code>.
<p>

Run the kernel inside QEMU GDB, setting a breakpoint
at the beginning of <code>main</code> (i.e., the address
you just found).  (Note: If you're running your own copy of QEMU and
have installed the QEMU accelerator kernel module (kqemu), you'll need
to disable kqemu for these exercises using the <tt>-no-kqemu</tt>
argument to QEMU in order to work around a bug in it's implementation
of breakpoints.)

<pre>
$ make qemu-gdb
...

[New Thread 1]
The target architecture is assumed to be i8086
[f000:fff0] 0xffff0:    ljmp   $0xf000,$0xe05b
0x0000fff0 in ?? ()
(gdb) br * 0x001024d0
Breakpoint 1 at 0x1024d0
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, 0x001024d0 in ?? ()
</pre>

The details of what you see are likely to differ from the above output.
Look at the registers and the stack contents:

<pre>
(gdb) info reg
...
(gdb) x/16x $esp
...
(gdb)
</pre>

Which part of the stack printout is actually the stack?
(Hint: not all of it.)  Identify all the non-zero values
on the stack.<p>

<b>Turn in:</b> the output of <tt>x/16x $esp</tt> with 
the valid part of the stack marked.  Write a short (3-5 word)
comment next to each non-zero value explaining what it is.
<p>

Make a copy of Makefile called Makefile.uni, find the line that starts
with <tt>QEMUOPTS</tt>, and change -smp 2 to -smp 1, and write out the
file.  Then run 
<pre>
make -f Makefile.uni qemu-gdb
</pre>

<p>
This will run QEMU with just one CPU.  Set a breakpoint at 0x0,
set it running, and continue past the first break:

<p>
<pre>
[f000:fff0] 0xffff0:    ljmp   $0xf000,$0xe05b
0x0000fff0 in ?? ()
(gdb) br * 0x0
Breakpoint 1 at 0x0
(gdb) c
Continuing.
[f000:   0] 0xf0000:    add    %al,(%bx,%si)

Breakpoint 1, 0x00000000 in ?? ()
(gdb) c
Continuing.
The target architecture is assumed to be i386
0x0:    push   $0x24

Breakpoint 1, 0x00000000 in ?? ()
(gdb) 
</pre>

<p>
The code that is running is from <tt>initcode.S</tt>; the
<tt>push 0x00000024</tt> is the first instruction of the first
user-level process. <tt>0x24</tt> is the address of some data; the
process is pushing the address so that the kernel can later
fetch the data.

<p>
<b>Turn in:</b> What physical address does the <tt>0x24</tt>
translate to? That is, if the code were at this point to load
32 bits from address <tt>0x24</tt>, from what physical address
would the data be fetched? What is the data at that address?

<p>
Hint: You can use <tt>&lt;Ctrl-a c&gt;</tt> in the terminal you launched
QEMU in to switch between the console and the QEMU monitor.  The QEMU
monitor command <tt>info registers</tt> will print information about
segments. You can use the <tt>xp /1xw addr</tt> QEMU monitor command to
print one 32-bit value from physical memory.
