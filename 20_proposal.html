<h1>Homework: Final Project Proposal</h1>

You will need to find a partner and come up with a project proposal.
You can work alone, but we prefer groups of two so that you have the resources to
create something big. You can use the class mailing list
(<a href="mailto:6.828-class@amsterdam.lcs.mit.edu">6.828-class@amsterdam.lcs.mit.edu</a>)
to organize if you do not have a partner.

<p>
The proposal must include:

<ul>
	<li> The names of your group members.
	<li> What you want to do.
	<li> What you are expecting to present (list of deliverables).
</ul>

Keep it short (few sentences). Do not hand in a hard copy, e-mail us
(<a href="mailto:6.828-staff@amsterdam.lcs.mit.edu">6.828-staff@amsterdam.lcs.mit.edu</a>)
your proposal instead.
