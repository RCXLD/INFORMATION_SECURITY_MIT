<H1>The Confused Deputy</H1>
<p> <b>(or why capabilities might have been invented)</b>
<p> <i>Norm Hardy</i>
<br> Senior Architect
<br> Key Logic, Inc.
<p> This is a nearly true story (inessential details have been
changed). The events happened about eleven years ago at Tymshare, a
company which provided commercial timesharing services. Before this
happened I had heard of capabilities and thought that they were neat
and tidy, but was not yet convinced that they were necessary. This
occasion convinced me that they were necessary.
<p> Our operating system was much like Unix ((TM) of AT&amp;T) in its
protection structures. A compiler was installed in a directory called
SYSX. A user would use the compiler by saying "RUN (SYSX)FORT", and
could provide the name of a file to receive some optional debugging
output. We had instrumented the compiler to collect statistics about
language feature usage. The statistics file was called (SYSX)STAT, a
name which was assembled into the compiler. To enable the compiler to
write the (SYSX)STAT file, we marked the file holding the compiler
{(SYSX)FORT} with <i>home files license</i>. The operating system
allowed a program with such license to write files in its home
directory, SYSX in our case.
<p> The billing information file (SYSX)BILL was also stored in
SYSX. Some user came to know the name (SYSX)BILL and supplied it to
the compiler as the name of the file to receive the debugging
information. The compiler passed the name to the operating system in a
request to open that file for output. The operating system, observing
that the compiler had home files license, let the compiler write
debugging information over (SYSX)BILL. The billing information was
lost.
<p> Who is to blame? What can we change to rectify the problem? Will
that cause other problems? How can we foresee such problems?
<p> The code to deposit the debugging output in the file named by the
user cannot be blamed. Must the compiler check to see if the output
file name is in another directory by scanning the file name? No--it is
useful to specify the name of a file in another directory to receive
output. Should the compiler check for directory name SYSX? No--the
name "SYSX" had not been invented when this code was written. Indeed
there might be a legitimate request for the compiler to deposit its
output in some file in SYSX made by someone with legitimate access to
that directory. Should the compiler check for the name (SYSX)BILL?
That is not the only sensitive file in SYSX. Must the compiler be
modified whenever new files are added to SYSX?
<p> When the code was written to produce the output it was correct!
What happened to make it wrong? The precise answer is that it became
wrong when we added home files license to (SYSX)FORT. To determine
this, however, would have required examination of every situation in
which the compiler wrote a file. Even when we identify those
situations it is not clear what to do.
<p> Another indication of trouble was that the rules allowing a
program to open a file grew more complex. The rules were suffering
from the law that complex things become more complex. Every time we
added a clause enabling the opening of a file in a categorical
situation we would introduce security problems in programs that had
been secure. Every time we added restrictions to these categories we
broke other legitimate programs. The last time that I wrote down the
requirements for a program to open a file, it required fourteen
boolean operators ("and"s &amp; "or"s)!
<p> The fundamental problem is that the compiler runs with authority
stemming from two sources. (That's why the compiler is a confused
deputy.)
<p> The invoker yields his authority to the compiler when he says "RUN
(SYSX) FORT". (This is of course the tool of Trojan horses which is
the companion problem in these access list architectures.) The other
authority of the compiler stems from its <i>home files
license</i>. The compiler serves two masters and carries some
authority from each to perform its respective duties.  It has no way
to keep them apart. When it produces statistics it intends to use the
authority granted by its home files license. When it produces its
debugging output it intends to use authority from its invoker. The
compiler had no way of expressing these intents!
<p> The system was modified by providing a new system call to
<i>switch hats</i> which could be used to select one of its two
authorities. Note the increase in complexity! The compiler would then
be able to use its home files license or the invoker's license
explicitly--in the later case, for example, saying "by the authority
vested in me by my invoker I hereby request the opening of (SYSX)BILL"
which would then properly fail. It soon became clear, however, that
more than two "authorities" were necessary for some of our
applications. A further problem was that there were other authority
mechanisms besides access to files. Generalizations were not obvious
and the modifications to the system were not localized. (Exercise for
the reader: Show that access lists do not solve this problem.)
<p> Another indication of poor design is that disparate mechanisms
were necessary to arrange separately that the compiler (1) know what
file to write on and (2) be authorized to write on that file. The
crime was perpetrated through unintended application of the compiler's
authority over SYSX when writing the user's data. (If you try to solve
this problem without capabilities, remember that the file (SYSX)STAT
must also be protected.)
<p> The capability solution would endow the compiler with a direct
capability to the statistics file. Instead of referring to the name of
the file, the compiler would merely designate that capability when
depositing the statistics. The capability both identifies the file and
authorizes the compiler to write there.  When producing the debugging
output the compiler would merely refer to a capability provided by the
invoker to the place he meant to hold that output.  The same mechanism
is used in each case--no ASCII character names are required, no
authority checking mechanisms are executed. We must not only endow the
compiler with authority over the STAT file but require the compiler to
explicitly designate that authority. In this case there is no need for
the compiler to know any textual file name.
<p> Before we implemented the capability ideas, we feared that a
system built on these principles would use most of the storage to hold
these mysterious new capabilities. Instead it turned out that
capabilities replaced so many other ad-hoc mechanisms that our
capability-based systems were usually smaller than equivalent
access-list based systems, because they unified not only various
naming functions, but also made older basic security mechanisms
largely unnecessary. That performance was excellent was a pleasant
extra.
<p> Some systems tried to add capabilities to the traditional
mechanisms and sometimes suffered more from the combined disadvantages
than benefitted from the combined advantages. Our view is that
capabilities must be the foundation of the system. We have carried out
that program more completely in some ways in our implementation of the
KeyKOS system [1, 2] than previous systems have.  KeyKOS has
directories and other such traditional operating system
facilities--they are implemented and accessed, however, via
capabilities.
<p> KeyKOS provides patented facilities [3] to aid deputies (and
defeat Trojan horses, viruses, and other related security threats),
while also providing flexibility to meet a broad range of security
policies--from government-style "orange book" policies [4] to useful
commercial policies including those requiring the solution of the
mutually suspicious users problem [5].
