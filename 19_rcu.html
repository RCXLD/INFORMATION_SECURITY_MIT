<h1>Homework: Read-Copy-Update</h1>

<p>
<b>Read</b>: <a href="../readings/rcu.pdf">Read-Copy Update paper</a>

<p>
<b>Hand-In Procedure</b>
<p>
You are to turn in this homework during lecture. Please
write up your answers to the exercises below and hand them in to a
6.828 staff member at the beginning of lecture.

<p>
<b>Read-Copy Update</b>

<p>
This paper describes an approach to eliminating read locks from data
structures that obey certain properties.  RCU has been used in various
subsystems of Linux (there are even <a
href="http://www.rdrop.com/users/paulmck/rclock/linuxusage.html">graphs</a>
of RCU usage in Linux).

<p>
Please, hand in an answer to the following question:

<p>
<table class="exercise"><tr><td>
The paper describes how they applied RCU techniques to Linux's file
descriptor arrays.  Why it safe for read-only access to the file
descriptor arrays to proceed without taking locks when RCU is used to
expand file descriptor arrays?  Why are read-only operations that are
operating on the "old" version of an array not in danger of accessing
freed memory?
