<h1>O/S overview</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<ul>
<li>6.828 goals:

<ul>
<li>Understand operating systems in detail by designing and
implementing a small O/S
<li>Hands-on experience with building systems  ("Applying 6.033")
</ul>

<li>What problems does an O/S solve?
<ul>
<li>that is, why not directly program the bare hardware?
<li>there are a lot of painful h/w details
<li>it wouldn't be portable
<li>you'd have to build up lots of functionality for yourself
<li>it's unlikely that a computer could run more than one app
</ul>

<li>What's the O/S solution?
<ul>
<li>e.g. OSX, Windows, Linux
<li>the small view: a h/w management library
<li>the big view: physical machine -> abstract one w/ better properties
<li>layer picture:
<ul>
<li>h/w: CPU, mem, disk
<li>kernel: [various services]
<li>user: applications, e.g. vi and gcc
</ul>
<li>we care a lot about the interfaces and internel kernel structure
</ul>

<li>what services does an O/S kernel typically provide?
<ul>
<li>processes
<li>memory
<li>file contents
<li>directories and file names
<li>interprocess communication
<li>many others: users, security policies, network, time, terminals
</ul>

<li>what makes a good kernel service design?
<ul>
<li>Abstract the hardware for programmer convenience
<li>Multiplex the hardware among multiple applications
<li>Isolate applications to contain bugs
<li>Allow sharing among applications
</ul>

<li>What does an O/S abstraction look like?
<ul>
<li>Applications only see them via system calls
<li>Examples, from UNIX / Linux:
<li><code>fd = open("/dev/foo", 1);</code>
<li><code>write(fd, "hello\n", 6);</code>
<li><code>pid = fork();</code>
</ul>

<li>Why is O/S design hard/interesting?
<ul>
<li>fast vs abstract
<li>many features vs few mechanisms
<li>interactions: <code>fd = open(); ...; fork();</code>
<li>interactions: CPU priority vs memory allocator.
<li>open problems: security, multi-core
</ul>

<li>You'll be glad you learned about operating systems if you...
<ul>
<li>want to work on the above problems
<li>care about what's going on under the hood
<li>have to build high-performance systems
<li>need to diagnose bugs or security problems
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>Class structure</h2>

<ul>

<li>Lectures
<ul>
<li>first, basic O/S ideas
<li>then extended inspection of xv6, a traditional O/S
<li>finally, a series of recent topics
<li>homework
</ul>

<li>Lab: JOS, a small O/S for x86 in an exokernel style
<ul>
<li>you build it, six labs, final project of your choice
<li>kernel interface: expose hardware, but protect -- no abstractions!
<li>unprivileged library: fork, exec, pipe, ...
<li>applications: file system, shell, ..
<li>development environment: gcc, qemu
<li>lab 1 is out
</ul>

<li>Two quizzes
<ul>
<li>mid-term (in class)
<li>final (during exam week)
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>Case study: the shell (simplified)</h2>

<ul>
<li>interactive command execution and a programming language
<li>typically handles login session, runs other processes
<li>look at some simple examples of shell operations, how they
    use different O/S abstractions, and how those abstractions
    fit together.
    See <a href="../readings/ritchie74unix.pdf">Unix paper</a>
    if you are unfamiliar with the shell.
<li>Final lab is a simple shell.
<li>Basic structure:
<pre>
	while (1) {
	    write (1, "$ ", 2);
	    readcommand (command, args);   // parse user input
	    if ((pid = fork ()) == 0) {  // child?
		exec (command, args, 0);
	    } else if (pid > 0) {   // parent?
		wait (0);   // wait for child to terminate
	    } else {
		perror ("Failed to fork\n");
	    }
	}
</pre>
<li>system calls: read, write, fork, exec, wait.
    conventions: -1 return value signals error,
    error code stored in <code>errno</code>,
    <code>perror</code> prints out a descriptive error
    message based on <code>errno</code>.
<li>What's the shell doing?
    fork, exec, wait: process diagram
    (PID, address space -- memory of the process, parent links).
    fork returns twice, in some sense!
<p>The split of process creation into fork and exec
    turns out to have been an inspired choice, though that
    might not have been clear at the time; see the
    <a href="../readings/ritchie79evolution.html">assigned paper</a>
    for today.

<li>why call "wait"?  to wait for the child to terminate and collect
    its exit status.  (if child finishes, child becomes a zombie until
    parent calls wait.)

<li>Example:
<pre>
	$ ls
</pre>
<li>how does ls know which directory to look at?
<li>how does it know what to do with its output?
<li>I/O: process has file descriptors, numbered starting from 0.
<li>system calls: open, read, write, close

<li>numbering conventions:
<ul>
<li>file descriptor 0 for input (e.g., keyboard). read_command: 
<pre>
     read (0, buf, bufsize)
</pre>
<li>file descriptor 1 for output (e.g., terminal)
<pre>
     write (1, "hello\n", strlen("hello\n"))
</pre>
<li>file descriptor 2 for error (e.g., terminal)
</ul>
<li>on fork, child inherits open file descriptors from parent (show in
    process diagram).
<li>on exec, process retains file descriptors, except those specifically
    marked as close-on-exec: <code>fcntl(fd, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC)</code>

<li>How does the shell implement:
<pre>
     $ ls > tmp1
</pre>
just before exec insert:
<pre>
	close(1);
	creat("tmp1", 0666);   // fd will be 1
</pre>
<p>The kernel always uses the first free file descriptor, 1 in this case.
    Could use <code>dup2()</code> to clone a file descriptor to a new number.

<li>Good illustration for why fork + exec vs. CreateProcess on Windows.
    (CreateProcess takes 24 arguments.)

<li>What if you run the shell itself with redirection?
<pre>
     $ sh < script > tmp1
</pre>
If for example the file <code>script</code> contains
<pre>
     echo one
     echo two
</pre>
FD inheritance makes this work well.

<li>What if we want to redirect multiple FDs (stdout, stderr)
    for programs that print to both?
<pre>
    $ ls f1 f2 nonexistant-f3 > tmp1 2> tmp1
</pre>
after creat, insert:
<pre>
	close(2);
	creat("tmp1", 0666);   // fd will be 2
</pre>
why is this bad?  illustrate what's going on with file descriptors.  better:
<pre>
	close(2);
	dup(1);		       // fd will be 2
</pre>
or in bourne shell syntax,
<pre>
    $ ls f1 f2 nonexistant-f3 > tmp1 2>&1
</pre>

<li>Linux has a nice representation of a process and its FDs, under /proc/PID/
<ul>
<li>maps: VA range, perms (p=private, s=shared), offset, dev, inode, pathname
<li>fd: symlinks to files pointed to by each fd.
    (what's missing in this representation?)
<li>can do fd manipulation in shell and see it reflected in /proc/$$/fd
</ul>

<li>how to run a series of programs on some data?
<pre>
	$ sort < file.txt > tmp1
	$ uniq tmp1 > tmp2
	$ wc tmp2
	$ rm tmp1 tmp2
</pre>
can be more concisely done as:
<pre>
        $ sort < file.txt | uniq | wc
</pre>
<li>A pipe is a one-way communication channel.  Here is a simple example:
<pre>
        int fdarray[2];
        char buf[512];
        int n;

        pipe(fdarray);
        write(fdarray[1], "hello", 5);
        n = read(fdarray[0], buf, sizeof(buf));
        // buf[] now contains 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'
</pre>
<li>file descriptors are inherited across <code>fork()</code>, so this also works:
<pre>
        int fdarray[2];
        char buf[512];
        int n, pid;

        pipe(fdarray);
        pid = fork();
        if(pid > 0){
          write(fdarray[1], "hello", 5);
        } else {
          n = read(fdarray[0], buf, sizeof(buf));
        }
</pre>
<li>How does the shell implement pipelines (i.e., cmd 1 | cmd 2 |..)?
We want to arrange that the output of cmd 1 is the input of cmd 2.
The way to achieve this goal is to manipulate stdout and stdin.
<li>The shell creates processes for each command in
the pipeline, hooks up their stdin and stdout,
and waits for the last process of the
pipeline to exit.  Here's a sketch of what the shell does,
in the child process of the <code>fork()</code> we already have,
to set up a pipe:
<pre>	    
	    int fdarray[2];

  	    if (pipe(fdarray) < 0) panic ("error");
	    if ((pid = fork ()) == 0) {  child (left end of pipe)
	       close (1);
	       tmp = dup (fdarray[1]);   // fdarray[1] is the write end, tmp will be 1
	       close (fdarray[0]);       // close read end
	       close (fdarray[1]);       // close fdarray[1]
	       exec (command1, args1, 0);
	    } else if (pid > 0) {        // parent (right end of pipe)
	       close (0);
	       tmp = dup (fdarray[0]);   // fdarray[0] is the read end, tmp will be 0
	       close (fdarray[0]);
	       close (fdarray[1]);       // close write end
	       exec (command2, args2, 0);
	    } else {
	       printf ("Unable to fork\n");
            }
</pre>
<li>Who waits for whom? (draw a tree of processes)
<li>Why close read-end and write-end? ensure that
every process starts with 3 file descriptors, and that
reading from the pipe returns end of file after the first command exits.
<li>How do you create a background job?
<pre>
        $ compute &
</pre>
<li>How does the shell implement "&", backgrounding?  (Don't call wait
immediately).
<li>More details in the shell lecture later in the term.
