<h1>Homework: Multiprocessor Synchronization</h1>

<p>
<b>Read</b>: <a href="../readings/mcs.pdf">Scalable Synchronization paper</a>

<p>
<b>Hand-In Procedure</b>
<p>
You are to turn in this homework during lecture. Please
write up your answers to the exercises below and hand them in to a
6.828 staff member at the beginning of lecture.

<p>
<b>Multiprocessor Synchronization</b>

<p>
The algorithms described in the Mellor-Crummey paper on scalable
synchronization are of importance to operating systems running on
multiprocessors. The kernels of such operating systems must be able to
acquire locks on data structures, such as the page table, that are
shared across all processors.

<p>
Don't be intimidated by the length of the paper---it is easy to read
and you can focus your attention on the MCS lock of figure 5.  (If you want to,
you can skip Section 3 "Barriers".)

<p>
Please, hand in an answer to the following question:

<p>
<table class="exercise"><tr><td>Why does the MCS lock guarantee
fairness of lock acquisition?</table>

<p>
<b>This completes the homework.</b>
