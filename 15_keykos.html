<ol>
    <li>Give an example of how an application running on top of the KeyKOS
	UNIX port (KeyNIX) can still suffer from the confused deputy problem.
    <li>Would we need to modify the application, the UNIX keeper, or
	the KeyKOS kernel to avoid the confused deputy problem in
	a program running on KeyNIX?
