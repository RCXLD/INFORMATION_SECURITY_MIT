<h1>6.828 Fall 2009 Lab 5: File System</h1>

<p>
<b>
Handed out Wednesday, November 4, 2009<br />
Due Thursday, November 12, 2009<br />
</b>
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
In this lab, you will implement a simple disk-based file system.
The file system itself will be implemented in micro-kernel fashion,
outside the kernel but within its own user-space environment.
Other environments access the file system by making IPC requests
to this special file system environment.
</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>
Use Git to commit your Lab 4 source, fetch the latest version of the course
repository, and then create a local branch called <tt>lab5</tt> based on our
lab5 branch, <tt>origin/lab5</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
athena% <kbd>cd ~/6.828/lab</kbd>
athena% <kbd>add git</kbd>
athena% <kbd>git commit -am 'my solution to lab4'</kbd>
Created commit 734fab7: my solution to lab4
 4 files changed, 42 insertions(+), 9 deletions(-)
athena% <kbd>git pull</kbd>
Already up-to-date.
athena% <kbd>git checkout -b lab5 origin/lab5</kbd>
Branch lab5 set up to track remote branch refs/remotes/origin/lab5.
Switched to a new branch "lab5"
athena% <kbd>git merge lab4</kbd>
Merge made by recursive.
 kern/env.c |   42 +++++++++++++++++++
 1 files changed, 42 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
athena% 
</pre>

<p> The main new component for this part of the lab is the file
system environment, located in the new <tt>fs</tt> directory.  Scan
through all the files in this directory to get a feel for what all is
new.  Also, there are some new file system-related source files in
the <tt>user</tt> and <tt>lib</tt> directories,
particularly <tt>lib/fsipc.c</tt>, <tt>lib/file.c</tt>,
<tt>lib/spawn.c</tt>,
and new global header files <tt>inc/fs.h</tt>
and <tt>inc/fd.h</tt>.
Be sure to scan through all of these files.
</p>

<p>
You should run the pingpong, primes, and forktree test cases from lab
4 again after merging in the new lab 5 code.  You will need to comment
out the <code>ENV_CREATE(fs_fs)</code> line in <tt>kern/init.c</tt>
because <tt>fs/fs.c</tt> tries to do some I/O, which JOS does allow
yet. Similarly, temporarily comment out the call to
<code>close_all()</code> in <tt>lib/exit.c</tt>; this function calls
subroutines that you will
implement later in the lab, and therefore will panic if called.  If
your lab 4 code doesn't contain any bugs, the test cases should run
fine.  Don't proceed until they work.
</p><p>
If they don't work, use <kbd> git diff lab4 | more </kbd> to review
all the changes, making sure there isn't any code you wrote for lab4
(or before) missing from lab 5.  Make sure that lab 4 still works.
</p>

<h3>Lab Requirements</h3>

<p>
As before, you will need
to do all of the regular exercises described in the lab and <i>at
least one</i> challenge problem.
Additionally, you will
need to write up brief answers to the questions posed in the lab and a
short (e.g., one or two paragraph) description of what you did to
solve your chosen challenge problem.  If you implement more than one
challenge problem, you only need to describe one of them in the
write-up, though of course you are welcome to do more.  Place the
write-up in a file called <tt>answers-lab5.txt</tt> (plain text)
or <tt>answers-lab5.html</tt> (HTML format) in the top level of
your <tt>lab5</tt> directory before handing in your work.
</p>

<h1>File system preliminaries</h1>

<p>
The file system you will work with is much simpler than most "real"
file systems including that of xv6 UNIX, but it is powerful enough to
provide the standard "basic" features: creating, reading, writing, and
deleting files organized in a hierarchical directory structure.
</p>

<p> We are (for the moment anyway) developing only a "single-user"
operating system, which provides protection sufficient to catch bugs
but not to protect multiple mutually suspicious users from each other.
Our file system therefore does not support the UNIX notions of file
ownership or permissions.  Our file system also currently does not
support hard links, symbolic links, time stamps, or special device
files like most UNIX file systems do.
</p>

<h2>On-Disk File System Structure</h2>

<p>
Most UNIX file systems divide available disk space into two main types
of regions:
<i>inode</i> regions and <i>data</i> regions.
UNIX file systems assign one <i>inode</i> to each file in the file system;
a file's inode holds critical meta-data about the file
such as its <code>stat</code> attributes and pointers to its data blocks.
The data regions are divided into much larger (typically 8KB or more)
<i>data blocks</i>, within which the file system stores
file data and directory meta-data.
Directory entries contain file names and pointers to inodes;
a file is said to be <i>hard-linked</i>
if multiple directory entries in the file system
refer to that file's inode.
Since our file system will not support hard links,
we do not need this level of indirection
and therefore can make a convenient simplification:
our file system will not use inodes at all,
but instead we will simply store all of a file's (or sub-directory's) meta-data
within the (one and only) directory entry describing that file.

</p><p>
Both files and directories logically consist of a series of data blocks,
which may be scattered throughout the disk
much like the pages of an environment's virtual address space
can be scattered throughout physical memory.
The file system allows user processes
to read and write the contents of files without going through the file
system environment,
but the file system handles all modifications to directories itself
as a part of performing actions such as file creation and deletion.
Our file system <i>does</i>, however, allow user environments
to <i>read</i> directory meta-data directly
(e.g., with <code>read</code> and <code>write</code>),
which means that user environments can perform directory scanning operations
themselves (e.g., to implement the <tt>ls</tt> program)
rather than having to rely on additional special calls to the file system.
The disadvantage of this approach to directory scanning,
and the reason most modern UNIX variants discourage it,
is that it makes application programs dependent
on the format of directory meta-data,
making it difficult to change the file system's internal layout
without changing or at least recompiling application programs as well.

</p><h3>Sectors and Blocks</h3>

Most disks cannot perform reads and writes at byte granularity,
but can only perform reads and writes in units of <i>sectors</i>,
which today are almost universally 512 bytes each.
File systems actually allocate and use disk storage in units of <i>blocks</i>.
Be wary of the distinction between the two terms:
<i>sector size</i> is a property of the disk hardware,
whereas <i>block size</i> is an aspect of the operating system using the disk.
A file system's block size <i>must be</i>
a multiple of the sector size of the underlying disk.

<p>
The UNIX xv6 file system uses a block size of 512 bytes,
the same as the sector size of the underlying disk.
Most modern file systems use a larger block size, however,
because storage space has gotten much cheaper
and it is more efficient to manage storage at larger granularities.
Our file system will use a block size of 4096 bytes,
conveniently matching the processor's page size.

</p><h3>Superblocks</h3>

<img src="disk.png" align="right" alt="Disk layout" />

<p>
File systems typically reserve certain disk blocks,
at "easy-to-find" locations on the disk
such as the very start or the very end,
to hold meta-data describing properties of <i>the file system as a whole</i>,
such as the block size, disk size,
any meta-data required to find the root directory,
the time the file system was last mounted,
the time the file system was last checked for errors,
and so on.
These special blocks are called <i>superblocks</i>.

</p><p>
Our file system will have exactly one superblock,
which will always be at block 1 on the disk.
Its layout is defined by <code>struct Super</code> in <tt>inc/fs.h</tt>.
Block 0 is typically reserved to hold boot loaders and partition tables,
so file systems generally never use the <i>very</i> first disk block.
Many "real" file systems maintain multiple superblocks,
replicated throughout several widely-spaced regions of the disk,
so that if one of them is corrupted
or the disk develops a media error in that region,
the other superblocks can still be found and used to access the file system.

</p><h3>The Block Bitmap: Managing Free Disk Blocks</h3>

<p>
In the same way that the kernel must manage the system's physical memory
to ensure that a given physical page is used for only one purpose at a time,
a file system must manage the blocks of storage on a disk
to ensure that a given disk block is used for only one purpose at a time.
In <tt>pmap.c</tt> you keep the <code>Page</code> structures
for all free physical pages
on a linked list, <code>page_free_list</code>,
to keep track of the free physical pages.
In file systems it is more common to keep track of free disk blocks
using a <i>bitmap</i> rather than a linked list,
because a bitmap is more storage-efficient than a linked list
and easier to keep consistent.
Searching for a free block in a bitmap can take more CPU time
than simply removing the first element of a linked list,
but for file systems this isn't a problem
because the I/O cost of actually accessing the free block after we find it
dominates for performance purposes.

</p><p>
To set up a free block bitmap,
we reserve a contiguous region of space on the disk
large enough to hold one bit for each disk block.
For example, since our file system uses 4096-byte blocks,
each bitmap block contains 4096*8=32768 bits,
or enough bits to describe 32768 disk blocks.
In other words, for every 32768 disk blocks the file system uses,
we must reserve one disk block for the block bitmap.
A given bit in the bitmap is set if the corresponding block is free,
and clear if the corresponding block is in use.
The block bitmap in our file system
always starts at disk block 2,
immediately after the superblock.
For simplicity we will reserve enough bitmap blocks to hold one bit
for each block in the <i>entire</i> disk,
including the blocks containing the superblock and the bitmap itself.
We will simply make sure that the bitmap bits
corresponding to these special, "reserved" areas of the disk
are always clear (marked in-use).

</p><h3>File Meta-data</h3>

<img src="file.png" align="right" alt="File structure" />

<p>
The layout of the meta-data describing a file in our file system is
described by <code>struct File</code> in <tt>inc/fs.h</tt>.  This
meta-data includes the file's name, size, type (regular file or
directory), and pointers to the blocks comprising the file. As
mentioned above, we do not have inodes, so this meta-data is stored in
a directory entry on disk.  Unlike in most "real" file systems, for
simplicity we will use this one <code>File</code> structure to
represent file meta-data as it appears
<i>both on disk and in memory</i>.
Some of the fields in the structure (currently, only <code>f_dir</code>)
are only meaningful while the <code>File</code> structure is in memory;
whenever we read a <code>File</code> structure from disk into memory,
we clear these fields.

</p><p>
The <code>f_direct</code> array in <code>struct File</code> contains space
to store the block numbers
of the first 10 (<code>NDIRECT</code>) blocks of the file,
which we call the file's <i>direct</i> blocks.
For small files up to 10*4096 = 40KB in size,
this means that the block numbers of <i>all</i> of the file's blocks
will fit directly within the <code>File</code> structure itself.
For larger files, however, we need a place
to hold the rest of the file's block numbers.
For any file greater than 40KB in size, therefore,
we allocate an additional disk block, called the file's <i>indirect block</i>,
to hold up to 4096/4 = 1024 additional block numbers.
To keep bookkeeping simple, we leave the first 10 numbers in the indirect block
unused.  Thus, the 10th block number is the 10th slot in the indirect block
(rather than the 0th, as might be done if we were being very space-efficient).
<!-- XXX FIX THE PICTURE -->
Our file system therefore allows files to be up to 1024 blocks,
or four megabytes, in size.
To support larger files,
"real" file systems typically support
<i>double-</i> and <i>triple-indirect blocks</i> as well.

</p><h3>Directories versus Regular Files</h3>

<p>
A <code>File</code> structure in our file system
can represent either a <i>regular</i> file or a directory;
these two types of "files" are distinguished by the <code>type</code> field
in the <code>File</code> structure.
The file system manages regular files and directory-files
in exactly the same way,
except that it does not interpret the contents of the data blocks
associated with regular files at all,
whereas the file system interprets the contents
of a directory-file as a series of <code>File</code> structures
describing the files and subdirectories within the directory. 

</p><p>
The superblock in our file system
contains a <code>File</code> structure
(the <code>root</code> field in <code>struct Super</code>),
which holds the meta-data for the file system's root directory.
The contents of this directory-file
is a sequence of <code>File</code> structures
describing the files and directories located
within the root directory of the file system.
Any subdirectories in the root directory
may in turn contain more <code>File</code> structures
representing sub-subdirectories, and so on.

</p><h1>The File System</h1>

<p>
The goal for this lab is not to have you implement the
entire file system, but for you to implement only certain key
components. In particular, you will be responsible for allocating disk
blocks, fetching file blocks from the disk and putting blocks in the
block cache, and marking blocks that get written as dirty so they get
correctly flushed to disk on close. Because you will not be
implementing all of the file system yourself, it is very important
that you familiarize yourself with the provided code and the various
file system interfaces.

</p><h2>Disk Access</h2>

<p>
The file system environment in our operating system
needs to be able to access the disk,
but we have not yet implemented any disk access functionality in our kernel.
Instead of taking the conventional "monolithic" operating system strategy
of adding an IDE disk driver to the kernel
along with the necessary system calls to allow the file system to access it,
we will instead implement the IDE disk driver
as part of the user-level file system environment.
We will still need to modify the kernel slightly,
in order to set things up so that the file system environment
has the privileges it needs to implement disk access itself.

</p><p>
It is easy to implement disk access in user space this way
as long as we rely on polling, "programmed I/O" (PIO)-based disk access
and do not use disk interrupts.
It is possible to implement interrupt-driven device drivers in user mode as well
(the L3 and L4 kernels do this, for example),
but it is more difficult
since the kernel must field device interrupts
and dispatch them to the correct user-mode environment.

</p><p>
The x86 processor uses the IOPL bits in the EFLAGS register
to determine whether protected-mode code
is allowed to perform special device I/O instructions
such as the IN and OUT instructions.
Since all of the IDE disk registers we need to access
are located in the x86's I/O space rather than being memory-mapped,
giving "I/O privilege" to the file system environment
is the <i>only</i> thing we need to do
in order to allow the file system to access these registers.
In effect, the IOPL bits in the EFLAGS register
provides the kernel with a simple "all-or-nothing" method
of controlling whether user-mode code can access I/O space.
In our case, we want the file system environment
to be able to access I/O space,
but we do not want any other environments
to be able to access I/O space at all.

</p><p>
To keep things simple,
from now on we will arrange things
so that the file system is <i>always</i> user environment 1.
(Recall that the idle loop is always user environment 0.)

</p><p>
In the tests that follow, if you fail a test, the <tt>obj/fs/fs.img</tt>
is likely to be left inconsistent.  Be sure to remove it before running
<kbd>make grade</kbd> or <kbd>make qemu</kbd>.

</p>
<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
Modify your kernel's environment initialization function,
<code>env_alloc</code> in <tt>env.c</tt>,
so that it gives environment 1 I/O privilege,
but never gives that privilege to any other environment.
</p><p>
Make sure you can start the file environment without causing a General
Protection fault.
</p></div>

<p>
Do you have to do anything else
to ensure that this I/O privilege setting
is saved and restored properly when you subsequently switch
from one environment to another?
Make sure you understand how this environment state is handled.

</p><p>
Read through the files in the new <tt>fs</tt> directory in the source tree.
The file <tt>fs/ide.c</tt> implements our minimal PIO-based disk driver.
The file <tt>fs/serv.c</tt> contains the <code>umain</code> function
for the file system environment.

</p><p>
Note that the <tt>GNUmakefile</tt> file in this lab
sets up QEMU to use the file <tt>obj/kern/kernel.img</tt>
as the image for disk 0 (typically "Drive C" under DOS/Windows) as before,
and to use the (new) file <tt>obj/fs/fs.img</tt>
as the image for disk 1 ("Drive D").
In this lab your file system should only ever touch disk 1;
disk 0 is used only to boot the kernel.
If you manage to corrupt either disk image in some way,
you can reset both of them to their original, "pristine" versions
simply by typing:

</p><pre>$ <kbd>rm obj/kern/kernel.img obj/fs/fs.img</kbd>
$ <kbd>make</kbd>
</pre>
<p>or by doing: </p>
<pre>$ <kbd>make clean</kbd>
$ <kbd>make</kbd>
</pre>

<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge!</span>
	Implement interrupt-driven IDE disk access,
	with or without DMA.
	You can decide whether to move the device driver into the kernel,
	keep it in user space along with the file system,
	or even (if you really want to get into the micro-kernel spirit)
	move it into a separate environment of its own.
</p></div>


<h2>The Block Cache</h2>

<p>
In our file system,
we will implement a simple "buffer cache"
with the help of the processor's virtual memory system.
Our file system will be limited to handling disks of size 3GB or less.
We reserve a large, fixed 3GB region
of the file system environment's address space,
from 0x10000000 (<code>DISKMAP</code>)
up to 0xD0000000 (<code>DISKMAP+DISKMAX</code>),
to map pages containing the corresponding disk block
when that disk block is in memory.
Pages of virtual address space in this region
for disk blocks that are not in memory are left unmapped.
For example,
disk block 0 is mapped at virtual address 0x10000000
whenever it is in memory,
disk block 1 is mapped at virtual address 0x10001000,
and so on.
The file system
can tell whether a block is mapped by consulting the <code>vpt</code>.
</p>

<p>
Since our file system environment has its own virtual address space
independent of the virtual address spaces
of all other environments in the system,
and the <i>only</i> thing the file system environment needs to do
is to implement file access,
it is reasonable to reserve most of the file system environment's address space
in this way.
It would be awkward for a "real" file system implementation
on a 32-bit machine to do this
since modern disks are larger than 3GB.
Such a buffer cache management approach
may still be reasonable on a machine with a 64-bit address space,
such as Intel's Itanium or AMD's Athlon 64 processors.
</p>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
Implement the <code>read_block</code> and <code>write_block</code> functions
in <tt>fs/fs.c</tt>.
The <code>read_block</code> function
should test to see if the requested block is already in memory,
and if not, allocate a page and read in the block
using <code>ide_read</code>.
Keep in mind that there are multiple disk sectors per block/page,
and that <code>read_block</code> needs to store the virtual address
at which the requested block was mapped in <code>*blk</code>.
</p><p>
The <code>write_block</code> function
may assume that the indicated block is already in memory,
and simply writes it out to disk.
We will use the VM hardware to keep track of whether a disk
block has been modified since it was last read from or written to disk.
To see whether a block needs writing,
we can just look to see if the <code>PTE_D</code> "dirty" bit
is set in the <code>vpt</code> entry.
(The <code>PTE_D</code> bit is set by the processor; see 5.2.4.3 in <a
href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2005/readings/i386/s05_02.htm">chapter
5</a> of the 386 reference manual.)
After writing the block, <code>write_block</code> should clear
the <code>PTE_D</code> bit using <code>sys_page_map</code>.
</p><p>
Use <kbd>make grade</kbd> to test your code.  Your code should score 20/100.
</p><p>
</p></div>

<h2>The Block Bitmap</h2>

<p>
After <code>fs_init</code> calls <code>read_super</code>
to read and check the file system superblock,
<code>fs_init</code> calls <code>read_bitmap</code> to read and
perform basic validity checking on the disk's block bitmap. For speed
and simplicity, our file system will <i>always</i> keep the entire
block bitmap in memory. This means that once the bitmap has been read
into memory, you can directly modify it to allocate and free blocks.
</p>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>
Use <code>free_block</code> as a model to
implement <code>alloc_block_num</code> and <code>alloc_block</code> to
allocate a new disk block and map the new block into the buffer
cache. The <code>alloc_block_num</code> function should find a block in the bitmap,
mark it as used and return the block
number. The <code>alloc_block</code> function should
use <code>alloc_block_num</code> to allocate a new block, then
allocate a page in the buffer cache for the newly allocated
block. When you allocate a block, you should <i>immediately</i> flush
the changed bitmap block to disk with <code>write_block</code>, to
help file system consistency.
</p><p>
Use <kbd>make grade</kbd> to test your code.  Your code should score 25/100.
</p></div>

<h2>File Operations</h2>

<p>
We have provided a variety of functions in <tt>fs/fs.c</tt>
to implement the basic facilities you will need
to interpret and manage <code>File</code> structures,
scan and manage the entries of directory-files,
and walk the file system from the root
to resolve an absolute pathname.
Read through <i>all</i> of the code in <tt>fs/fs.c</tt> <i>carefully</i>
and make sure you understand what each function does
before proceeding. 
</p>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 4.</span>  We have left out two
important functions: <code>file_block_walk</code>
and <code>file_map_block</code>. Implement these functions for finding
the disk block number for a particular file block.
</p></div>

<p>
You may notice that there are two operations conspicuously absent
from this set of functions implementing "basic" file operations:
namely, read and write.
This is because our file system environment
will not implement read and write operations 
on behalf of client environments,
but instead will use our kernel's IPC-based page remapping functionality
to <i>pass mapped pages</i> to file system clients,
which these client environments can then read and write directly.
The page mappings we pass to clients will be
exactly those pages that represent in-memory file blocks
in the file system's own buffer cache, fetched via
<code>file_get_block</code>.
You will see the user-space <code>read</code> and <code>write</code> a
little later in the lab.
</p>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 5.</span>
  Implement <code>file_get_block</code>, which returns a pointer to
  the file block in the block cache. You will be
  using <code>file_get_block</code> later to find the right page to
  pass to the client environment when the client requests particular
  file block.

  Implement <code>file_dirty</code> to mark a file block as dirty in
  the block cache. Think about why we need a function to explicitly
  tell the file system environment when a page is modified and why the file
  system environment cannot just rely on the <code>PTE_D</code> bits in its own
  mappings.
</p><p>
Use <kbd>make grade</kbd> to test your code.  Your code should score 50/100.
</p></div>


<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge!</span>
	The file system code uses synchronous writes
	to keep the file system fairly consistent in the event of a crash.
	Implement soft updates instead.
</p></div>

<h2>Client/Server File System Access</h2>

<!-- XXX perhaps we should change ipc_send so that the
error handling can be done by serve -->

<p>
Now that we have implemented the necessary functionality
within the file system environment itself,
we must make it accessible to other environments
that wish to use the file system.
There are two pieces of code required to make this happen:
client stubs and server stubs.
Together, they form a <i>remote procedure call</i>, or RPC, abstraction,
where we make IPC-based communication across address spaces appear
as if they were ordinary C function calls within client applications.
</p>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 6.</span>
The <i>server stubs</i> are located in the file system environment itself,
implemented in <tt>fs/serv.c</tt>.
These stubs accept IPC requests from clients,
decode and validate the arguments,
and serve those requests using the file access functions in <tt>fs/fs.c</tt>.
We have provided stubs for most of the file system environment's IPCs,
but you will need to implement stubs
for the <code>map</code> and <code>dirty</code> IPCs
(<code>serve_map</code> and <code>serve_dirty</code>). 
Hint: look at the comments in <code>serve_set_size</code>.
</p></div>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 7.</span>  The <i>client stubs</i>
are in <tt>lib/fsipc.c</tt>. Finish <code>fsipc_map</code>
and <code>fsipc_dirty</code>, which call the server stubs you just
implemented. Use the other IPC requests to help you figure out the
exact protocol between the client and the server.
</p><p>
Use <kbd>make grade</kbd> to test your code.  Your code should score 55/100.
</p></div>


<h2>Client-Side File Operations</h2>

<p>
Although we can write applications
that directly use the client-side stubs in <tt>lib/fsipc.c</tt>
to communicate with the file system environment and perform file operations,
this approach would be inconvenient for many applications
because the IPC-based file system server interface is still somewhat "low-level"
and does not provide conventional read/write operations.
To read or write a file,
the application would first have to reserve a portion of its address space,
map the appropriate blocks of the file into that address region
by making requests to the file system environment,
read and/or change the appropriate portions of those mapped pages,
and finally send a "close" request to the file system environment
to ensure that the changes get written to disk.
We will write library routines
to perform these tasks on behalf of the application,
so that the application can use conventional UNIX-style file access operations
such as <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, and <code>seek</code>.

</p><p>
The client-side code
that implements these UNIX-style file operations
is located in <tt>lib/fd.c</tt> and <tt>lib/file.c</tt>.
<tt>lib/fd.c</tt> contains functions
to allocate and manage generic Unix-like file descriptors,
while <tt>lib/file.c</tt> specifically implements file descriptors
referring to files managed by the file system environment.

</p><p>
The file descriptor layer defines two new virtual address regions
within each application environment's address space.
The first is the <i>file descriptor table</i> area,
starting at address <code>FDTABLE</code>,
reserves one 4KB page worth of address space
for each of the up to <code>MAXFD</code> (currently 32)
file descriptors the application can have open at once.
At any given time,
a particular file descriptor table page is mapped
if and only if the corresponding file descriptor is in use.

</p><p>
The second new virtual address region is the <i>file mapping area</i>,
starting at virtual address <code>FILEBASE</code>.
Like the file descriptor table,
the file mapping area is organized as a table indexed by file descriptor,
except the "table entries" in the file mapping area
consist of 4MB rather than 4KB of address space.
In particular,
for each of the <code>MAXFD</code> possible file descriptors,
we reserve a fixed 4MB region in the file mapping area
in which to map the <i>contents</i> of currently open files.
Since our file system only supports files of up to 4MB in size,
these client-side functions are not imposing any new restrictions
by only reserving 4MB of space to map the contents of each open file.

<p><span class="header">Exercise 8.</span>
Implement <code>fmap</code>
and <code>funmap</code>. The <code>fmap</code> function maps the
pages of a file into the client's address space by making a call
to <code>fsipc_map</code> for each page to be
mapped. The <code>funmap</code> function unmaps pages from the
client's address space by notifying the file system environment of
each modified
page and removing the client's page mapping.
</p></div>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 9.</span>
Implement <code>open</code> and <code>file_close</code>.
The <code>open</code> function must find an unused file descriptor
using the <code>fd_alloc()</code> function we have provided, make an IPC
request to the file system environment to open the file, and then map all the
file's pages into the appropriate reserved region of the client's
address space using the <code>fmap</code> function that you just
implemented.  Be sure your code fails gracefully if the maximum number
of files are already open, or if any of the IPC requests to the file
system environment fail.
</p><p>
The <code>file_close</code> function should use <code>funmap()</code>
to tell the file system environment which file pages the client has written,
and to unmap all of the file's pages from the client address space.
Then <code>file_close</code> should send a close IPC to the
file system environment.
</p><p>
Use <kbd>make grade</kbd> to test your code.  Your code should score
75/100 (or 100/100 if you implemented
sys_env_set_trapframe in lab 4).

<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge!</span>
	Add support to the file system environment and the client-side code
	for files greater than 4MB in size.
</p></div>

<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge!</span>
	Make the file access operations lazy,
	so that the pages of a file are only mapped
	into the client environment's address space when they are touched.
	Be sure you can still handle error conditions gracefully,
	such as the file system environment running out of memory
	while the application is trying to read a particular file block.
</p></div>

<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header">Challenge!</span>
	Change the file system
	to keep most file meta-data in Unix-style inodes
	rather than in directory entries,
	and add support for hard links.

<h2>Spawning Processes</h2>

<p>
We have given you the code for <code>spawn</code>
<!-- In this exercise you will implement <code>spawn</code>, -->
which creates a new environment,
loads a program image from the file system into it,
and then starts the child environment running this program.
The parent process then continues running independently of the child.
The <code>spawn</code> function effectively acts like a <code>fork</code> in UNIX
followed by an immediate <code>exec</code> in the child process.
</p>
<p>
We implemented <code>spawn</code> rather than a
UNIX-style <code>exec</code> because <code>spawn</code> is easier to
implement from user space in "exokernel fashion", without special help
from the kernel.  Think about what you would have to do in order to
implement <code>exec</code> in user space, and be sure you understand
why it is harder.
</p>

<div class="required">
<p><span class="header">Exercise 10.</span>  Make
sure <code>spawn</code> works for you. You may have to
implement <code>sys_env_set_trapframe</code> if you did not in lab
4. Test your code by running the <tt>user/icode</tt> program
from <tt>kern/init.c</tt>, which will attempt to
spawn <tt>/init</tt> from the file system.

Use <kbd>make grade</kbd> to test your code.  Your code should score 100/100.
